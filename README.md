# Duke Robotics Club Wiki

Welcome to the Duke Robotics Club Wiki! This is a place for us to document our projects and share our knowledge with the world. If you're a member of the club, feel free to add to this wiki. If you're not a member, feel free to browse around and see what we're up to!

This site is built using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). To view it locally, install the Docsify CLI using `npm install -g docsify-cli` and then run `docsify serve` in the root directory of this repository. You can then view the site at `localhost:3000`.

All content on the `main` branch is automatically deployed to [dukerobotics.github.io/wiki](https://dukerobotics.github.io/wiki).

## Contributing

To contribute to this wiki, first create a new branch or switch to an existing one other than `main`. Then, create a new markdown file or edit an existing file. When you are done, merge your changes into `main` and they will be automatically deployed to the website.

Please refrain from committing directly to `main` except for immediate changes. Please consult a club officer before making any major changes to the site.
